# Machine LearningFree Courses
## Introduction
In order to help peopleembrace the full power of machine learning. I decided to make opensource courses on some popular machine learning problems.

In this repository, you will find several jupyter notebooks that can help you study various machine learning techniques.

## Requirements
This assumes that the user has at least rudimentary knowledge of python programming language.
Sometimes we use pospular machine learning libraries. Since this repository is not a tutorial on the libraries themselves, I'll be linking to pages that adress these issues every time we use one of these.

## Hardware
For the best challenging applications, you will need a machine capable of running heavy matrix operations and it is preferable to have a gpu that supports cuda 8.0 or later.

If you don't have one. Since we are doing fully opensource stuff here, I advise you to use the Google Colabolatory platform that allows you to access high processing power for free and can execute jupyter notebooks. So you'll be ready to go in no time.

## Conclusion

Just have fun
